# Comparable Cities in Europe

## Abstract

Finding a feasible control group is central to many empirical methods in order to obtain reliable results as described above. This section describes an applied strategy for identifying comparable cities that can be used as a control group in further analytical steps.

Since randomized control trials are not feasible for studying the impact of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), we need to develop a strategy for identifying a good comparison group that serves as a proxy for the NbS-treated city. Since perfect comparability is not feasible in real-world examples, we rely on an applied matching strategy where we aim to identify a comparison city for each city included in the project. We focus on CiPeLs, which are the project cities including e.g. Munich (Germany) and Leuven (Belgium), as well as cities that have already implemented NbS measures. These cities and the corresponding information on the NbS strategies adopted have been collected by the experts of this project.[^complete_list_cities]
